# telecom_churn_prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values and class imbalance using RandomOverSampler. A Random Forest Classifier was used to build the model, achieving 88% accuracy and 96% recall for churned customers. The goal is to help telecom companies identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take preventive actions. The project was built using Python in Google Colab with libraries like pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, and imblearn.
